This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Python comparison functions.  The `my_function` is designed to return the maximum of two numbers. It works correctly for unequal numbers but fails when the inputs are the same. The solution showcases how to fix this problem and provides a robust comparison function that handles all cases appropriately.
